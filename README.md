[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1483d258-f50f-4b99-bbff-fd1cf5b27a98/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nikstoyanov/deploys)

The repository holds the content of my personal website hosted on netlify:
- Org-mode notebooks are in the /org directory
- Jupyter notebooks are in the /notebook directory

To export:
- For org-mode use [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/)
- There is no native support for jupyter in hugo so use a custom script such as [nb\_hugo\_exporter](https://github.com/jbandlow/nb_hugo_exporter)

The website is build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) version 0.52 and the [hyde-hyde](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-hyde/) theme version 2.0.2.
