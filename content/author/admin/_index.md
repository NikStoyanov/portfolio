Hello! My name is Nikola Stoyanov and I am a materials science PhD student at the
[University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

My current research activities include the numerical element modeling of
the structural and thermal resistance of shell elements using cohesive
fracture models during low and high temperature exporures. I am also 
trying to figure out a way to make predictions without excessive computations and access to expensive
software - analytical solutions are *very* difficult, but maybe new
emerging methods can hold an answer.
