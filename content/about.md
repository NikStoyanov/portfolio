## About {#about}

Hello! My name is Nikola Stoyanov and I am a PhD student at the
[University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/) in the [Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil
Engineering department](http://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/). I also did my MEng degree in Civil
Engineering - again in Manchester.

My research interests are the structural and material performance of
low carbon steel when exposed to cryogenic temperatures (more
specifically Liquefied Natural Gas) and followed by hydrocarbon fire.

My current research activities include the finite element modeling of
the structural and thermal resistance of shell elements using cohesive
fracture models. I am also trying to figure out a way to make
predictions without excessive computations and access to expensive
software - analytical solutions are VERY difficult, but maybe new
emerging methods can hold an answer.

Furthermore, I am involved in developing pyCM which is an open source
package to perform the contour method for determining residual stress
in components.

Aside from research I work part-time for my PhD sponsor company -
Exova, where I perform R&D activities related to my
project. Furthermore, I am responsible for developing the calculating
softwares which we employ to engineering assessment work for fire
protection materials on steels.

The purpose of this blog is to showcase my work in order to
communicate it with other people. However, I would also use it to show
something which has interested me or I find really fun.

Below you will find a breakdown of my education, employment and work.
For mode detailed information please refer to my CV.
