* Hi
I have just finished building this blog from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]]. My
intention is to blog about my work during my PhD and since I do almost
all of my report writing work in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] I needed a system with which
I can upload content quickly and easily.

The website is built using the script detailed in the [[https://ogbe.net/blog/blogging_with_org.html][blog]] of Dennis
Ogbe using nothing else but the built-in functionality of Org Mode and
some elisp.

We can test some functionality to make sure everything is working as
expected. Let's say hello properly!

Welcome to my blog!
