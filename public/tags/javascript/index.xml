      <description>Sketching   
Creating sketches/drawings for an outreach event targeted at non-technical audience is time consuming and it would be best to reuse what we already have. In my case all of my figures are generated using PGF/TikZ and are great quality, however, I would not consider them suitable for some audiences. In this post I am showing the use of Rough.js to convert my figures to sketches targeted for school outreach events.</description>
