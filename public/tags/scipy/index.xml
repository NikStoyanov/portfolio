      <description>Recently I had to reconstruct a solution for the thermal boundary between boiling cryogenic liquid and a steel plate. The temperature of the cryogenic-steel boundary is extremely difficult to measure experimentally since the mere presence of the thermocouples would affect the nucleation of bubbles which in turn affect the heat extraction. Also modeling the boiling phenomena is a great computational challenge which is too great of a topic to undertake for this problem.</description>

      <description>Introduction I recently rewatched a video from Arthur C. Clarke which is where I first saw what fractals are. I saw this video while I was in high school and having rewatched it now I wondered if I can generate the Mandelbrot set and explore some parts of it myself. I did a quick search online and I discovered that Jean Francois Puget had already done that and achieved great results.</description>
