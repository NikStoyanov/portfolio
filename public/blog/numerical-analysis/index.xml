      <description>I recently rewatched a video from Arthur C. Clarke which is where I first saw what fractals are. I saw this video while I was in high school and having rewatched it now I wondered if I can generate the Mandelbrot set and explore some parts of it myself. I did a quick search online and I discovered that Jean Francois Puget had already done that and achieved great results. Learning from his work I decided to do some computational experiments.</description>
