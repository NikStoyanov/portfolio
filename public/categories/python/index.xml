      <description>Introduction Having used support vector machines (SVM) for classification problems I decided to learn the theory behind them the lack of which is probably the principal reason for my poor results. Following my study I took notes in jupyter which I eventually converted into orgmode and now decided to turn into a blog post. The structure of this post is:
 Theory : mathematical formulation of SVM and solver Visualisation : python code for exploring SVM Exploration : show how SVM work in practise  Theory We start off with the idea that we want to separate a space by decision boundaries in order to carry out classification.</description>
