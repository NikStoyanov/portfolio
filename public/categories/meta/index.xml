      <description>About Hello! My name is Nikola Stoyanov and I am a PhD student at the University of Manchester in the Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering department. I also did my MEng degree in Civil Engineering - again in Manchester.
  My research interests are the structural and material performance of low carbon steel when exposed to cryogenic temperatures (more specifically Liquefied Natural Gas) and followed by hydrocarbon fire.</description>

      <description>Hi I have just finished building this blog from Emacs and Org Mode. My intention is to blog about my work during my PhD and since I do almost all of my report writing work in Org Mode I needed a system with which I can upload content quickly and easily.
The website is built using the script detailed in the blog of Dennis Ogbe using nothing else but the built-in functionality of Org Mode and some elisp.</description>
